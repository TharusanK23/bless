## Building from Source

## Why choosing the GetX state management?
Performance: focused on minimum consumption of memory and resources.
Productivity: intuitive and efficient tool combined with simplicity and straightforward syntax that ultimately saves development time.
Organization: decoupling business logic from view and presentation logic cannot get better than this.
